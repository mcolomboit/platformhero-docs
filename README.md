## About PlatformHero
PlatformHero is a test application for **GraphRAG** (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation), designed to enhance advanced data interaction and analysis using diverse data sources within the **Microsoft Power Platform**. Ideal for researchers, educators, and data enthusiasts, PlatformHero combines AI-powered search with dynamic data visualization.

## Behind the Scenes
PlatformHero leverages several technologies to deliver robust data insights:

1. **[Microsoft GraphRAG](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/)**  
   A technique that integrates text extraction, network analysis, and LLM-driven summarization for deep insights into text datasets.

2. **[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)**  
   A graph database for managing complex data relationships, central to the GraphRAG model.

3. **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)**  
   Provides AI-driven embedding and natural language processing to generate contextual answers.

4. **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)**  
   Framework for building applications powered by language models, enabling complex data processing and seamless LLM integration.

5. **[Upstash](https://upstash.com/)**  
   A Redis-based caching service, implemented to manage rate limits and ensure efficient data handling.

6. **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**  
   Stores logs for analytics, tracking search trends, and refining the user experience.

7. **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**  
   Hosting for a fast, responsive frontend interface built with Next.js.

8. **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)**  
   Backend hosting using FastAPI, allowing for real-time data streaming and scalable infrastructure.
